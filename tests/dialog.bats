# bin/redispass.py draws its dialog on the terminal, not in the hook's pipe.
#
# firstboot.d/35redispass reads the script's standard output for KEY=value,
# and dialog draws its screen on standard output. On 2026-09-30 a
# keel-wordpress first boot on Proxmox froze at a password box because the
# box was drawn into such a pipe, and this script had the same shape. These
# tests run the script as the hook does, output redirected, inside a real
# pseudo terminal (script(1)), with a stand-in for libinithooks whose dialog
# refuses to draw anywhere but a terminal.
